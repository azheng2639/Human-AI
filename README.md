# CSVis

CSVis is a web application that allows users to upload CSV files and interact with the data through a chat interface. The application uses AI to generate responses and visualizations based on the provided data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSVis.git
   cd CSVis
   ```

2. **Install the frontend dependencies:**

   ```

3. **Install the backend dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

   - The application will parse the CSV file and display a preview of the data.

2. **Interact with the Chat Interface:**

   - Enter your questions or commands in the chat input box and press "Send".
   - The AI will process your input and provide responses based on the uploaded CSV data.
   - Visualizations generated by the AI will be displayed within the chat interface.
